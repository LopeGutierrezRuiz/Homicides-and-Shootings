# Essays on tracking homicides and shootings

** 1) Why is there no comprehensive and official data source on either number of homicides, gun-related homicides, or police-related homicides? **

Among many different co-existing causes, the most important one could be that U.S. Department of Justice is not enforcing a comprehensive policy of data collection. Added to this is the fact that the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program was established under a voluntary-involvement-only rule, so local agencies need to opt in, instead of opt out of it. Lastly, outside of of the government sphere, there are two additional problems: Obstructionist practices from groups that support “gun rights” (e.g. the Tiahrt Amendments, passed with support of NRA-backed groups), and lack of public or private funding for research in the topic.

** 2) What official sources exist and what are their limitations? And why do those limitations exist? **

Among others:

- Death Certificates, as compiled on the National Vital Statistics System by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- National Violent Death Reporting System.
- FBI UCR.
- Supplementary Hoicide Report forms.

The main limitations in all of them is the lack of an standardized model of data collection across agencies, along with “wide” but not “deep” data collection, purposely made to avoid incrimination of police officers during ongoing investigations.

** 3) How have independent researchers been able to collect data? **
FOIA requests, RSS bots that search for key terms on regular basis, regularly updated API’s on local agencies. Lots of sweat.

** 4) What obstacles have they run into? **
Among some of the most important ones:

- Suicides are usually not reported in media to avoid positive reinforcement.
- There are too many different death causes to be classified by crowdsourcing efforts.
- Systemic lack of detail in police reporting.
- Lack of interest of private investors to fund structured journalism ventures.
